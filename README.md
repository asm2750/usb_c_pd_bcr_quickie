# USB-C PD Barrel Connector Replacement

A USB-C Power Delivery BCR Example Design:
* Based on example design from the CYPD 3177 Datasheet
* Configurable output voltage and current with resistors
* Header included for additional configuration

# WHY?
I needed a 9V wall wart for a device I recently acquired. Instead of buying another wall wart I wanted to leverage the many USB-C power supplies I have.

# Future Modifications
* Add a rotary switch for rapid voltage changes
* Design a 3D printable case
* Add proper BOM, v0.1 design was fabricated and assembled at JLCPCB
